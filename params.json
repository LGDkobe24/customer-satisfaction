Currently, I'm using http://text-processing.com's API to perform the sentiment analysis. This will be changed in subsequent versions to use my own algorithm.\r\n\r\nThe tweets collected are taken over a period of 1 week, again, this will be expanded to include a much larger data set soon.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, the result which I got.\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eldor4do/customer-satisfaction/master/results/CustomerE-Commerce.png) \r\n\r\nSurprisingly, Myntra performs poorly, and Snapdeal looks to be way better than the giants like Amazon and Flipkart!\r\n\r\nFurther more analysis will be added.\r\nThe codes taken to extract, calculate and plot the data, along with the tweets and the result is provided in the project file.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
